This Twitter plugin allows you to publish your latest twitter updates as a widget on your blog.

== Description ==

You can select how many updates you wish to publish on your website, including options to make URLs into hyperlinks, replies into hyperlinks as well as supporting the plugin.

For example, if URLs into hyperlinks is enabled, your twitter message of http://www.jakeruston.co.uk would turn into a link.

If replies into hyperlinks is enabled, your twitter message of @Jake_Ruston would link to the recipient's twitter profile.

New to version 1.1.0 is the ability to include your username in the title of the widget. Simply add %user% into the header and it will be replaced by your username when it is displayed. You can also link the title to your twitter profile, to allow users to visit your twitter profile and follow you.

In version 1.3.0, you can now enable your Twitter profile image to be shown along side your tweets!

In version 1.4.0, caching can be enabled, to stop it from calling back to twitter on every pageview! It also makes the plugin quicker!

Also, as of 1.5.0, you can now include your location and the number of followers you have, all in the title of your widget! Simply type %location% to display your location and %followers% to display the followers - It will automatically replace them!

As of version 2.0.0, you can now change the colour of the tweets, as well as resize your profile image to fit in with your website!
